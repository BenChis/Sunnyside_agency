# Code
My Code could be a bit better organised because I started some weeks ago and finished the project just now. 

# Improving
I definitely can notice my improvement in the semantic layout when I read my code I noticed that I could have used fewer lines for the same results, but I just took it as I got it to finish this respiratory. 
For my next projects, I organise better so I need fewer lines of code.

# Results
What I like is I didnÂ´t use Java Scprit for my toggle nav bar on top of my page. I used pseudo-classes, different properties to animate it. 

# Responsiveness
The layout is perfect for a mobile resolution of a 385px and desktop of 1435px. Everything works responsively
